title: Conditional breakpoints in Xdebug with phpStorm
---

How many times did you modify that big loop of yours just to make phpStorm enter a debugging session in the right time?

Well that times are over now, thanks to phpStorm and its [conditional breakpoints](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/phpstorm/configuring-breakpoints.html)!
Now why didn't I know that fancy functionality exists. I feel really pity for myself.

Just add a breakpoint, right click on it and add your condition:

Run your code and let the magic happen.
