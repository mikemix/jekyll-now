title: Conditional Xdebug breakpoints in phpStorm
---

How many times did you modify that big loop of yours just to make phpStorm enter a debugging session in the right place at the right time?

Well, that times are over now, thanks to phpStorm and its [conditional breakpoints](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/phpstorm/configuring-breakpoints.html)! Why didnâ€™t I know that fancy functionality exists? I feel really pity for myself.

Just add a breakpoint, right click on it and add your condition. And yes, those are pure PHP conditions, go bananas!

Run your code and let the magic happen.
