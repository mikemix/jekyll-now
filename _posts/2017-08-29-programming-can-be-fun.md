title: Conway's Game of Life implementation in PHP
---

It's really enjoyable sometimes to lay your daily activities and do anything fun topic. I managed to find some spare time recently so I got my hands on [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) topic and did a simple implementation in PHP7.

It's a simple algorithm, just 3 rules honestly, developed by [John Conway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway) almost 40 years ago now. I'm not going to cover the topic thoroughly here though.

The results can be found at [GitHub](https://github.com/mikemix/game-of-life). Should you have Docker installed, the whole can be run with just one command.

I'm going to develop this from time to time for sure. I really hope that :)
